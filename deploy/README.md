# what's this for
We can get from [Mishards](shards/README.md) milvus can be deployed with Mishards  as cluster to support massive-scale(10 billion, 100 billion or even larger datasets). However, when it comes to case that datasets is limited(say, millions or tens million) and low latency„ÄÅhigh throughput is required, Mishards cannot handle it.
Here, we give a proposal to solve the problem above.
